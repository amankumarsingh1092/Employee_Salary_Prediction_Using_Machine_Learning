The Income Classification App is a user-friendly web application built using Streamlit that predicts whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on demographic and employment attributes. It utilizes a trained machine learning classification model and supports both single-entry predictions via form inputs and batch predictions through CSV uploads.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, model training, and real-time deployment using Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and joblib. It's a compact example of end-to-end machine learning application deployment with an interactive UI.
